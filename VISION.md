Two main "views" controllable with button input to GPIO pins.
View 1 is live stream from ISS
View 2 is latest image of Earth from GOES16 satellite - not sure about looping this or not or which view(s)

GOES data pulls from here - static addresses. Maybe rotate around thru a couple different feeds?
Bare minimum is latest CONUS view.
